# Unity VR C# TableTennis CodeBase
 Table tennis project in C#

This is a small fun project made with the Massive Loop SDK for a Massive Loop game world!

Feel free to check it out at : https://home.massiveloop.com/
and our SDK is available for download at : https://massiveloop.com/download/sdk/

With documentation available at : https://docs.massiveloop.com/

We recently have allowed the usage of C# scripting which gives a lot of freedom to our creators.
This is one of many fun projects that I've started in order to test out the limits of our new C# compiler.
Also I think that creating a fun Table Tennis game that could be played in VR sounds pretty fun!
